Overview
--------

BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible techno-economic analysis. BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications.

   A simplified UML class diagram of the core classes of BioSTEAM.

The :doc:`Species` object defines the working compounds of the biorefinery. When a Species object is created, it identifies compounds by name and stores pure chemical properties as :doc:`compounds/Chemical` objects. :doc:`Stream` objects define material flows, and estimate mixture properties and thermodynamic equilibrium. Before estimating equilibrium, a Stream object is cast to a :doc:`MixedStream` object to enable multiple phases. A :doc:`Unit` object stores input and output Stream objects in the `ins` and `outs` attributes respectively. A :doc:`System` object serves to define a `network` of unit operations, functions, and subsystems, as well as a `recycle` stream (if any). When a System object is simulated, each network element is run sequentially within an iterative solver until the recycle stream converges (in both component flow rates and temperature). A :doc:`TEA` object can perform cashflow analysis on a system given a set of options. Adjustments can be made to the available heating and cooling agents of the :doc:`HeatUtility` class (e.g., steam pressure, cooling water temperature, price) as well as the electricity price of the :doc:`PowerUtility` class.

Licence
^^^^^^^
We intend to keep BioSTEAM perpetually open source and to use a liberal
open source license. As a contributor to the project, you agree that
any contributions be licensed under the terms of the corresponding
subproject. All of the code in BioSTEAM is available under the University
of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, which boils down to this:

* You can freely distribute BioSTEAM 
* You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute BioSTEAM 
* Binaries derived from BioSTEAM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an included readme file).
* You can't use our names to promote your BioSTEAM derived products.
* There's no warranty on BioSTEAM at all.

We believe this fosters the widest adoption of BioSTEAM because it allows
commercial products to be derived from BioSTEAM with few restrictions and
without a requirement for making any derived works also open source
(i.e. BioSTEAM license is not a "copyleft" license like the GPL). We
suggest that you read the `License <https://github.com/yoelcortes/biosteam/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__. 
if further clarification is needed.
