BioSTEAM: The Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules
=========================================================================

BioSTEAM enables the design, simulation, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and 
life cycle assessment (LCA) of biorefineries across thousands of scenarios for
streamlined uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Complete biorefinery 
configurations are available at the `Bioindustrial-Park <https://github.com/yoelcortes/biosteam>`_ 
GitHub repository, BioSTEAM's premier repository for biorefinery models and 
results. The long-term growth and maintenance of BioSTEAM is supported 
through both community-led development and the research institutions invested 
in BioSTEAM, including the `Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts 
Innovation (CABBI) <https://cabbi.bio/>`_. Through its open-source and 
community-lead platform, BioSTEAM aims to foster communication and transparency 
within the biorefinery research community for an integrated effort to expedite 
the evaluation of candidate biofuels and bioproducts.

Scientific Papers
-----------------

Several studies have leveraged the BioSTEAM platform to compare conversion 
technologies and chart development pathways for various bioproducts:

Overview
--------

BioSTEAM's main components can be categorized by 4 functionality levels:

- :orange:`Automation` of the simulation of large sets of scenarios is facilitated by :doc:`../API/evaluation/Model` objects which define Parameter and Metric objects that dictate the input and output features of the model. 

- :red:`Simulation` is carried out by :doc:`../API/System` objects, which can be created without supplying any information on the order of unit simulation. After simulation, :doc:`../API/TEA` objects can perform cashflow analysis to solve for a number of financial indicators.

- :blue:`Equipment` design, costing, and utility requirements are evaluated by :doc:`../API/Unit` objects. All built-in and custom unit operations are subclasses of Unit. Adjustments can be made to the heating and cooling agents of the :doc:`../API/HeatUtility` class (e.g., steam pressure, price) as well as the electricity price of the :doc:`../API/PowerUtility` class.

- :green:`Thermodynamic` equilibrium and mass and energy balances are facilitated by :doc:`../API/thermosteam/Stream` objects, which define material flows, temperature and pressure. Chemical properties and models are imported from `thermo <https://thermo.readthedocs.io/>`_, a community-driven open-source library developed by Caleb Bell. 

Installation
------------

If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install biosteam


To get the git version, run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ git clone --depth 10 git://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam


Common Issues
-------------

* **Cannot install/update BioSTEAM:**

  If you are having trouble installing or updating BioSTEAM, it may be due to dependency issues. You can bypass these using:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install --user --ignore-installed biosteam

  You can make sure you install the right version by including the version number:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install biosteam==<version>

* **Unit and system diagrams are not displaying:**

  BioSTEAM uses `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`__ to make flowsheet diagrams. To properly install Graphviz in an anaconda distribution, please run the following line:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ conda install graphviz

  Additionally, please follow the following instructions for `installing graphviz on windows <https://forum.graphviz.org/t/new-simplified-installation-procedure-on-windows/224#format-svg-not-recognized-use-one-of>`__.
