Key Features & Capabilities
---------------------------

BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible techno-economic analysis. BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications. BioSTEAM is capable of streamlining and automating process and technology evaluations for rigorous uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. BioSTEAM does not yet have a GUI, but flowsheets of all streams, unit operations, and recycle systems can be instantaneously generated. Two complete biorefineries models are included in BioSTEAM: the co-production of ethanol and biodiesel from lipid-cane, and 2nd generation ethanol production from corn stover. Please refer to the tutorial to get started.

Licence
-------
We intend to keep BioSTEAM perpetually open source with a liberal
open source license. All of the code in BioSTEAM is available under the
University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, which boils down to this:

* You can freely distribute BioSTEAM.
* You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute BioSTEAM.
* Binaries derived from BioSTEAM must reproduce the copyright notice.
* You can't use our names to promote your BioSTEAM derived products.
* There's no warranty on BioSTEAM at all.

Any contributions to the project must be licensed under these terms.
We believe this fosters the widest adoption of BioSTEAM as it allows
commercial products to be derived from BioSTEAM with few restrictions and
without a requirement for making any derived works also open source
(i.e. not a "copyleft" license). If further clarification is needed,
we suggest that you read the `License <https://github.com/yoelcortes/biosteam/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__.
