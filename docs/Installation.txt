Common Issues
-------------

* **Unit and system diagrams are not displaying:**

  BioSTEAM uses `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`__ to for making flowsheets. To properly install Graphviz in an anaconda distribution, please run the following line:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ conda install graphviz

  You may also need to add Graphviz to your system path on Windows by following these `instructions <https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GVIZ/pages/20971549/How+to+install+Graphviz  +software>`__.


* **Cannot install/update BioSTEAM:**

  If you are having trouble installing or updating BioSTEAM, it may be due to dependency issues. You can bypass these using:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install --user --ignore-installed biosteam


* **BioSTEAM version is not the latest:**

  You can make sure you install the right version with the following line:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install biosteam==<version>

  Where `<version>` is the version number.
