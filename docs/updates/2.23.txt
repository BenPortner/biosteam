v2.23
=====

2.23.1
------

New features:

* New `ins` and `outs` property for :class:`~biosteam.System` objects to set feeds and products to the system.
  
* New :func:`~biosteam.process_tools.system_factory.system_defaults` decorator for setting default values 
  for functions that create systems.

* The :class:`~biosteam.System` convergence algorithm now terminates if the convergence error of each component is 
  below both the absolute and relative molar tolerance. Previously, the convergence algorthm terminated if the 
  total sum of convergence errors were below both the absolute and relative molar tolerance

Bug fixes:

* Bug fixes to -pipe- notation. When connecting a stream to a unit operation with a flexible number of streams 
  (e.g., mixers), the number of streams stay fixed. Previously, stream-0-mixer would disconnect other streams
  attached to the mixer (not just replace the 0th inlet).  
* Bug fixes to the :mod:`~biosteam.evaluation` module for compatibility with version 4 of the chaospy library.
