BioSTEAM: The Open-Source Bioprocess Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules in Python
==============================================================================================

BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible preliminary technoeconomic analysis.

Overview
--------

.. figure:: UML.png

   **Figure 1.** A simplified UML class diagram depicts the core classes of BioSTEAM. Only main attributes and methods are included. In aggregation relationships, the labels represent where the aggregates are stored.

:doc:`Compound`: Base class for objects with pure component thermodynamic and transport properties.

:doc:`Chemical`: A thermo.Chemical object from the Chemical Engineering Design Library (ChEDL) with minor extensions for compatibility.

:doc:`Species`: Contains Compound and Chemical objects that will be accessed by Stream objects.

:doc:`Stream`: Used to pass material information between units and calculate material properties.

:doc:`MixedStream`: An extension of the Stream class that can handle multi-phase flow with phase equilibria.
   
:doc:`Unit`: A base class for all unit operations.

:doc:`HeatUtility`: Contains settings for heating agents and cooling agents (e.g. price, pressure, compostion, etc.). Unit objects use HeatUtility objects to specify cooling and heating requirements.

:doc:`PowerUtility`: Contains the price of electricity. Unit objects use a PowerUtility object to specify electricity demand.

:doc:`System`: Iteratively runs a `network` of units, functions and subsystems until the `recycle` stream converges.

:doc:`TEA`: Used to perform techno-economic analysis given a System object and a set of options.

Tutorial
--------

BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications.
