BioSTEAM: The Open-Source Bioprocess Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules in Python
==============================================================================================

BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible preliminary technoeconomic analysis.

Overview

.. figure:: UML.png

   **Figure 1.** A simplified  Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram depicts the core classes of BioSTEAM. Only main attributes and methods are included. In aggregation relationships, the labels represent where the aggregates are stored.

**Classes**:
 
:doc:`Chemical`: A thermo.Chemical object from the Chemical Engineering Design Library (ChEDL) with minor extensions for compatibility. It contains pure component transport and thermodynamic properties.

:doc:`Species`: Contains Specie and Chemical objects.

:doc:`Stream`: Used to pass material information between units. Stream properties are calculated using ideal mixture rules and pure component data from the Species object.

:doc:`MixedStream`: An extension of the Stream class that can handle multi-phase flow with phase equilibria.
   
:doc:`Unit`: A base class with an abstract `run` method that changes output streams given parameters and input streams. Other abstract methods including `operation`, `design`, and `cost` are used after process simulation for design and costing.

:doc:`System`: Iteratively runs a network, `network`, of units until the `recycle` stream converges. When a network contains a system, it converges the inner system first and then continues running the remaining elements.


Getting Started
---------------

BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications.

To get started, follow the :doc:`Tutorial`.
