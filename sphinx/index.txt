BioSTEAM: The Bioprocess Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules
========================================================================

BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible preliminary technoeconomic analysis. BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications.


Overview

   **Figure 1.** A simplified UML class diagram depicts the core classes of BioSTEAM.

To complete TEA of a process, first create a :doc:`Species` object to define the working compounds of the process. When a Species object is created, it identifies compounds by name and stores pure chemical properties as :doc:`Chemical` objects. Then, use :doc:`Stream` objects to define material flows, and estimate mixture properties and thermodynamic equilibrium. Before estimating equilibrium, a Stream object is cast to a :doc:`MixedStream` object to enable multiple phases. A :doc:`Unit` object stores input and output Stream objects in the `ins` and `outs` attributes respectively. A :doc:`System` object serves to define a `network` of unit operations, functions, and subsystems, as well as a `recycle` stream (if any). When a System object is simulated, each element in the network is run sequentially within an iterative solver until the recycle stream converges (in both component flow rates and temperature). The use of functions in the network allows for flexible behavior in the process to satisfy process specifications. A :doc:`TEA` object can be created from a System object to perform cashflow analysis given a set of options. Don't forget to make adjustments to the available heating and cooling agents of the :doc:`HeatUtility` class (e.g., steam pressure, cooling water temperature, price) as well as the electricity price of the :doc:`PowerUtility` class.
